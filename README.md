# Stormtroopers
Through this project, we have created a website that teaches young children about the solar system in a fun and interactive way. This team project was completed in the fall of 2022 for the Fundamentals of Software Engineering course, where the core focus was on adopting the Agile framework and methodology of Scrumban.
